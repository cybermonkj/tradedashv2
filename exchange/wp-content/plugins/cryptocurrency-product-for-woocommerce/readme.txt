Cryptocurrency Product for WooCommerce enables customers to buy Ether, Bitcoin or any ERC20 or ERC721 token on your WooCommerce store for fiat USD, Bitcoin or any other currency or cryptocurrency supported by WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Cryptocurrency Product for WooCommerce is the only one WooCommerce plugin that allows you to sell Ether, Bitcoin or any ERC20 or ERC721 token for fiat money like USD, EUR, ... or any cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin or any other WooCommerce supports. You can sell your Ether or any ERC20 or ERC721 token for USD, EUR, or even Ether or another ERC20 token by using the [Ether and ERC20 tokens WooCommerce Payment Gateway](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ether-and-erc20-tokens-woocommerce-payment-gateway/) plugin.

> It can be a valuable addition to your ICO strategy with the [Ethereum ICO WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ethereumico/) plugin!

> The [Wordpress Ethereum Wallet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ethereum-wallet/) plugin auto-creates a user wallet upon registration and allows user to send Ether or ERC20 tokens from it. Using these two plugins your non-techie customers can register to obtain an Ethereum account address and then buy your tokens to be sent to this new address.
